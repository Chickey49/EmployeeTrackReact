## About the Project  
<img src='Screenshot of app.jpg'></img>
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
This application utilizes an API call to generate a list of employees, then react hooks allows state to be manipulated to sort alphabetically or search for a user.
## Usage  
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
